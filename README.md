  kierandansey.co.uk - v5
</h1>
<p align="center">
  The fifth iteration of my personal website, <a href="https://kierandansey.co.uk" target="_blank">kierandansey.co.uk</a>, built with Typescript, Tailwind <a href="https://nextjs.org/" target="_blank">Next.js</a> and hosted with <a href="https://www.netlify.com/" target="_blank">Netlify</a>
</p>

<p>
  In this version I was able to remove the Framer Motion animation library in favour of the Web Animations API (WAAPI). WAAPI is used to handle the landing page "welcome animations" after the initial SVG loader has finished animating. This initial SVG loader graphic uses anime.js to handle animations.

<p>
  I have also opted to use the Next.js 13 app folder structure, using both server rendered components
  and client rendered components.
